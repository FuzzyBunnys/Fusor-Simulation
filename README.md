# Fusor Simulation
This all started out as a way of applying some of the stuff I was learning in my numerical methods and electromagnetics classes at UVic. It's grown a bit subsequently as I found it interesting in its own right. While there's not a ton of simulation work that's been done on Fusors, I'm aware of [some work](https://mattlilley.com/research/electrostatic-fusion/) by Matthew Lilley investigating the dynamics of the fusor. [Liam David](https://fusor.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=14157) has done some top flight work on the Fusor.net forums using particle simulations. This repository serves as a listing of the work I've done so far. 
## An Analytic Quadrople in 2D
This [marimo notebook](https://marimo.app/l/b4igi2) contains an explanation of my attempts to find a solution for a question posted on the Fusor.net forums. Long story short, there was a known solution and the attached notebook is my longform notes of my implementation of the solution. Lots of learning about conformal mapping to get it complete!
## A 2D Venetian Blind
This [python simulation](https://github.com/FuzzyBunnys/Fusor-Simulation/blob/main/SimulationGaussSeidel.py) is two dimensional, it uses a finite difference approximation to calculate the electric potential of a metal electrical grid. The current code implements the electric potential of a [venetian blind](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0029-5515/13/1/005) direct energy conversion system. I used the image in my end of degree technical report. A great help in optimizing the speed of this program was the following wonderful [post](https://mattferraro.dev/posts/poissons-equation) by Matt Ferraro. The code is all contained within the SimulationGaussSeidel.py file available on this github repo.

## Some Electrostatic Knot Fields in 3D 
These are a number of three dimensional simulations of the electric field generated by different grids. It's directly inspired by the work of [Max Lipton](https://e.math.cornell.edu/people/ml2437/). I rewrote his own open source code in Julia as an exercise in learning last Christmas. These simulations are all written in Pluto notebooks, and they operate as follows. A knot shape is parametrized in three dimensional space by some equation and then the electric field is generated via a quadrature integration scheme. A marching cubes algorithm is then used to find a level surface which is plotted to give the final image. There are three notebooks total at the moment but unfortunately I can't figure out how to upload them in a way that allows for their code to work. To get the full effect I would suggest downloading the files from my GitHub and running them locally using Julia. The three notebooks are included in the appropriately name .jl files.
